:name_badge: Simulate battles in a parallel universe

The original concept for the sacred Name Battle was proposed by [@vikram-ravindran](https://github.com/vikram-ravindran) during a magnificent state of pure lucidity during which he was capable of anything he so desired. He desired to unveil the Name Battle to the world, and so it was:

> The purpose of this function is to simulate a battle in a parallel universe in which, when a person attacks another person (the target), they do so by absorbing letters in the target's name that match the attacker's name, and the percentage of letters left over gives the current life-force level of the target as a percentage (100% is full-health)
